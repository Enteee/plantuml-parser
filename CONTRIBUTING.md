# Contributing

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.

## Our Development Process

We use GitHub to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.
See [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) for more information about our development process.

## Pull Requests

We actively welcome your pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.

## Issues

We use GitHub issues to track feature requests and public bugs. Please ensure
your description is clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to
reproduce the issue.

Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code. **Great Bug Reports**
tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
